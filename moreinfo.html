 <h3> Here I will explain my service and what I do for each.</h3>
 
 <ol>
 <li> Full Lash Sets: Each Lash extension is placed on an individual natural lash. /li>
 <li> Lash Baths: A shampoo treatment for your lashes. It is usally performed after a lash removal, before a full set or fill.</li>
 <li> Lash Removals: Using Lash glue removal, lash fans are removed. </li> 
 <li> Lash Fill-ins: After a couple weeks lashes start to shed so a fill is to replace the shedded lashes.</li>
